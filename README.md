### Inconclude

In this study, we conducted this experiment to find out how the CMC SBR binder, which is most used when graphite is used as an active material, harmonizes with PEI through the PEI ratio.
In the process of formation, the CMC/SBR sole binder was the highest capability and the next was CMC/SBR+PEI 8:2. For this, we can estimate the SEI layer was well created in sole and 8:2. In the cycle performance graph to see the persistency of cell, the Coulomb efficiency is unstable at 5:5. But, 8:2 shows that the ratio is stable. Lastly, in the rate capability graph, the specific capacity of the starting point is high in the order of CMC/SBR alone, CMC/SBR+PEI 8:2, CMC/SBR+PEI 2:8, and CMC/SBR+PEI 5:5.
As the result of this experiment, the initial efficiency is the highest in CMC/SBR alone, but the PEI mixed battery is safe when the surface of the slurry is broken during the pressing process. In addition, since the capacity loss according to the number of cycles is the smallest ratio of 8:2, the capacity loss caused by continuous charging and discharging is the smallest.
Therefore, it may be seen that a CMC/SBR+PEI 8:2 ratio, which has the smallest capacity loss according to continuous charge and discharge and has good cell performance, is better than other ratios or alone when silicon is used as an anode.
